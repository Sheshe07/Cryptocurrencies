# Cryptocurrencies
## Summary
Through out my research with my co-worker Martha I was able to learn and understand what supervised learning is used for. Not only do I understand it I was also able tomput it to use by learning how to process data, how to cluster, how to reduce my deminsions, and how to clean and how to reduce the pricipal compnents using PCA. The Advisory Service Team at Acountablity Accounting, which is the company Martha and I work for is offering a new crytocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. They asked Martha to create a report that includes what crytocurrencies are on the trading market and how they can be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. To creasted that report Marth dcided to used unsupervised learning. And to group the cryptocurrencies, Martha decided on a clustering algorithm. With that we  was able to remove rows that have at least one null value. And create a new DataFrame that holds only the cryptocurrency names, and use the crypto_df DataFrame index as the index for this new DataFrame.
